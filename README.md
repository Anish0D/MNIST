This is a ReadME for the MNIST dataset to use Neural Networks

The Universal workflow for a Neural Network is to:

1) Initialize the Model with code
2) Create a Loss function to measure accuracy
3) Choose an optimizer
4) Write a loop so it trains through the data
5) Test it with the data it has not seen yet
